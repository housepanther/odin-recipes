Odin Recipes Project

This a recipe list with some of my favorite foods. The idea was for me to practice the use of headings, images, links, and ordered and unordered lists. I also decided to look up the HTML codes for the ingredient fractions to render correctly and to lookup the code for the degrees symbol associated with temperatures. Additionally, I got some practice with commits and commit messages when I neglected to setup the unordered list correctly on the index.html page and forgot to add the necessary alt text for the images.
